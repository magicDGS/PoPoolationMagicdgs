# PoPoolation (personal fork)

PoPoolation is a pipeline for analysing pooled next generation sequencing data described in 
[Kofer __et al.__ (2011)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0015925).

This is a personal fork from the [SourceForge repository](https://sourceforge.net/p/popoolation/code)
for adding extra features to the code.
